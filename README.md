# ERC20 

The file named "Exercice_Solution.sol" represents the ERC20 token, built on the base of an ERC20 token from openzeppelin.

The file "1_td_deploy.js" was used to work locally, with the "Evaluator.sol" and "ERC20TD".

The file "2_td_deploy.js" is called during migration to trigger the functions in the Evaluator deployed on Rinkeby.
